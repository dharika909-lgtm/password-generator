# 🔐 Password Generator in Python

This is a beginner-friendly **Password Generator** built in Python.  
The program creates a secure password based on user preferences such as:

- Minimum length  
- Whether to include numbers  
- Whether to include special characters  

This project helped me practice:
✔ Python functions  
✔ Looping  
✔ String handling  
✔ Conditional logic  
✔ Random character generation

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user:
   - Minimum password length  
   - If numbers should be included  
   - If special characters should be included  

2. It randomly picks characters until:
   - The password is long enough  
   - It includes required types (numbers/special characters)  

3. Finally, it prints the generated password.
